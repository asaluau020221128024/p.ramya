<b><p class="description" style="color:red">PREPARATION OF VADA</p></b><br>
Medu Vada is a popular South Indian breakfast snack of donut shaped lentil fritters that are fluffy, crispy, soft and delicious. If sweet breakfast isnâ€™t your thing, try this recipe for savory spiced donuts made with black gram lentils, spices and herbs. Traditionally paired with Sambar and Coconut Chutney, these make for a comforting, filling and satisfying breakfast or snack.
