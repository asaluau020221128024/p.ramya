<b><p class="description" style="color:red">PREPARATION OF PAYASAM</p></b><br>
Semiya payasam is a creamy, sweet vermicelli pudding from the South Indian cuisine. This cardamom scented vermicelli payasam comes together in 20 minutes and can be made by beginners too. Being so easy, you can make it any day when you fancy something sweet or for any festive or religious occasion. I share both stove-top and Instant pot method for making this delicious semiya payasam recipe.

<br>Mix very well with a spoon. ...
<br>Cook the rice grains till they are 50% done or half-done. ...
